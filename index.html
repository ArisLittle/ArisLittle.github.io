      When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city.
      Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral walls encrusted spiral screens,
      where perfect telephones and buses are made,
      where the foreigner hesitating between two kinds of food always encounters a third,
      where e-sports degenerate into all-night revelries among the teenagers.
      He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city.
      Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference.
      The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age.
      In the square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by;
      he is seated in a row with them.
      Desires are already <a href="./home.html">memories</a>.
