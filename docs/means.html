    <p>OK, in other words. What theory means is really solving this toy problems and solving these toy problems first.</p>
    <p>And in terms of practice, some people think the most practical thing is to be practical. And the whole piont of this course, and this particular subject of detection is a wonderful example of this: the most pratical thing is to be theoretical.</p>
    <p>I mean you need to add practice to the theory. But the way you do things is you start with the theory, which means you start with the toy problems, you build up from those toy problems and after you build up for a while, understanding what the practical problem is also, you then understand how to deal with the practical problem.</p>
    <p>And the pratical engineer who doesn't have any idea of that fundamental knowledge about how to deal with these problems is always submerged in a sea of complexity, always doing simulatons of something he or she doesn't understand, always trying to interpret something from it, but with just too many things going on to have any idea of what it really <a href="./means.html">means</a>.</p>
